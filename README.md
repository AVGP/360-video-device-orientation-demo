# 360-video-device-orientation-demo
Shows how to display 360° video using Three.js and the device orientation

# Setup

1. Run `npm install` in the project directory
2. Run `npm run build` to build a minified version or `npm run dev` to build unminified and rebuild on changes
3. Add a 360° video file and name it `test.mp4`. Put it in the main directory.
4. Run a local static webserver and access the files via HTTP

# Making changes

You can modify the application by editing files in the `js` directory, most notably `main.js`.
You will need to re-bundle it using either `npm run build` or it should happen automatically if `npm run dev` was started before your changes and is still running.
